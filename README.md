# HackPrinceton2016

By: Jordana Approvato, Jennifer Cafiero, and Laura Oliveto

This is our project we made for HackPrinceton Fall 2016. We call it: Cancel My Plans. 

Have you ever been roped into plans that you'd rather just not go to? Need a quick excuse where your friend won't ask you too many questions? We have gathered some of the best excuses we could think of to make an excuse generator for your every day use. Enjoy!
